# AI_voice-assistant
Here is the python notebook which I built for my final year (AI) project, as part of my undergraduate degree. The artefact of this project is a Gen AI Voice-Assistant with User-Accent-Replication practice. Over 300 hours of research has been invested in success of this project, achieving 1st class score for the project report and demo.

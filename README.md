# AI_voice-assistant
Here is the python notebook, a part of the project that I built for my final year (AI) project. The artefact of this project is a Gen AI Voice-Assistant with User-Accent-Replication practice. Over 300 hours of research and development has been invested in success of this project, achieving 1st class score for the project report and demonstration.
